# odin-recipes
My first proper project using git. I will need to learn git and use all the HTML knowledge I have accumulated so far. At the end of the lesson, I will further edit this file to reflect on what I have heard.

## Reflection
I learned a lot from this project, primarily about Git and Commit messages. Different situations I encountered encouraged me to play around a little, which created some very rewarding moments when things worked out. For example "git add"ing everything and then removing the one file that was meant for a seperate commit (because I forgto to commit) instead of staging all files except the one. This was only really possible because of how basic it is. I knew most of the HTML already, so that allowed me to focus on the git side of things. This adds to the idea that I should go back and do Odin a second time to pick up things I have missed.
